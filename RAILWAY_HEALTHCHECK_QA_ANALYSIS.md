## 3. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys Method)

### Primary Failure Path

**Problem**: Railway health check returns 500/503 errors

**Why 1**: The health check endpoint is not responding correctly
- Evidence: Multiple attempts with different implementations all fail
- Finding: The issue is systematic, not implementation-specific

**Why 2**: The Django application is not initializing properly in Railway
- Evidence: Fallback health check in railway_wsgi.py suggests Django initialization failure
- Finding: Line 60-73 in railway_wsgi.py shows emergency fallback is triggered

**Why 3**: The Python path and module imports are failing
- Evidence: `os.chdir(str(DJANGO_ROOT))` on line 26 attempts to change directory
- Finding: Railway may not allow directory changes or path doesn't exist as expected

**Why 4**: The file structure in Railway differs from local development
- Evidence: Complex path resolution logic in lines 17-26 of railway_wsgi.py
- Finding: The assumption that files are in specific locations may be incorrect

**Why 5**: The build process (Nixpacks) places files differently than expected
- Evidence: nixpacks.toml tries to run commands from root level
- Finding: The relative path assumptions are breaking the initialization chain

### Secondary Failure Paths

#### Configuration Loading Failure
1. Django settings module not found
2. Environment variables not properly set
3. RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT check fails
4. Falls back to wrong settings
5. Application crashes on initialization

#### WSGI Application Binding Failure
1. Gunicorn starts with wrong application path
2. Module import fails
3. WSGI application object not created
4. Gunicorn reports application error
5. Health check fails with 503

---

## 4. Testable Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Path Resolution Failure (90% confidence)
**Test**: Add explicit logging of all path variables at startup
```python
print(f"__file__: {__file__}")
print(f"PROJECT_ROOT: {PROJECT_ROOT}")
print(f"DJANGO_ROOT: {DJANGO_ROOT}")
print(f"sys.path: {sys.path}")
print(f"os.getcwd(): {os.getcwd()}")
```

### Hypothesis 2: Module Import Failure (85% confidence)
**Test**: Wrap Django imports in try-catch with detailed error logging
```python
try:
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    print("✅ Django import successful")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"❌ Django import failed: {e}")
    print(f"Python path: {sys.path}")
```

### Hypothesis 3: Environment Variable Issues (80% confidence)
**Test**: Log all environment variables at startup
```python
import os
print("Environment Variables:")
for key, value in os.environ.items():
    if 'SECRET' not in key and 'PASSWORD' not in key:
        print(f"  {key}: {value[:50]}..." if len(value) > 50 else f"  {key}: {value}")
```

### Hypothesis 4: Working Directory Restrictions (75% confidence)
**Test**: Remove os.chdir() and use absolute paths only
```python
# Instead of os.chdir(str(DJANGO_ROOT))
# Use absolute imports with full paths
```

### Hypothesis 5: Gunicorn Configuration (60% confidence)
**Test**: Simplify gunicorn command to minimum viable
```bash
gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

## 5. Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Deployment (Immediate)
1. Create diagnostic version with extensive logging
2. Deploy with all hypotheses tests included
3. Collect logs within first 60 seconds
4. Analyze path and import issues

### Phase 2: Minimal Viable Configuration (2 hours)
1. Strip down to absolute minimum Django app
2. Remove all middleware except essentials
3. Hardcode paths if necessary
4. Test basic WSGI response

### Phase 3: Incremental Build-up (4 hours)
1. Add Django components one by one
2. Test after each addition
3. Identify breaking point
4. Document working configuration

### Phase 4: Production Configuration (6 hours)
1. Apply findings to full application
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Validate all endpoints

## 8. Long-term Recommendations

### Architecture Improvements
1. **Containerization**: Move to Docker for consistent environments
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform for Railway configuration
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement staged deployments with automatic rollback
4. **Monitoring**: Add APM tools (New Relic, DataDog)
5. **Load Balancing**: Implement blue-green deployments

### Process Improvements
1. **Environment Parity**: Ensure dev/staging/prod are identical
2. **Automated Testing**: Add deployment smoke tests
3. **Documentation**: Create runbooks for common issues
4. **Incident Response**: Establish on-call procedures
5. **Post-Mortems**: Document all production issues
